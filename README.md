# Anomaly Detection with Bayesian Neural Networks

\
First final dissertation in the scopes of my MSc Statistics with Data Science (University of Edinburgh). \
The scope of this project was to establish the limitations of frequentist neural networks, in capturing different types of generated uncertainty.\
Ways to visualise and capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are explored in this report (pdf file).

The writing was asked to be in the style of a **non-technical** summary (readable by people of many backgrounds that have a concept of Neural Networkds established) of a maximum 5000 words.


## Packages Used (Python)
 
Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow  & Tensorflow Probability (Keras)


## Files within repository


Report-Anomaly-Detection-with-Bayesian-Neural-Networks.pdf: Finalised submitted report. Received grade: Upper 2.1 

Poster.pdf: Finalised Poster that was used in my presentation. Received Grade: 1st

anomaly-detection-with-bayesian-neural-networks.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used in my assignment. Will be modified with additional documentation over time.

To Be Added: HTML version (with printed outputs) of the above notebook 






## Future Implementations

The techniques used will be explored on a different project (outside the scopes of my MSc) for image classification and time series prediction examples.
